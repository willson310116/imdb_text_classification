# imdb_text_classification
## Abstract
This is a simple application of using dataset from `keras.datasets.imdb` to train a DNN to predict movie review sentiment(positive/negative).
Besides data from keras and the imdb dataset on Kaggle, I also tried to craw some data from official website of imdb to see whether the model
works on other movie review as well.
## Usage
To be added
1. `imdb.py` is for training the DNN model.
2. `imdb_craw.ipynb` is for crawing data from official website of imdb and simply verify the prediction.
